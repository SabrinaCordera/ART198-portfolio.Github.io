        <h2>Sabrina Cordera</h2>
        <h3>3D Artist</h3>
        <p>Sabrina Cordera is a BFA Digital Media art major at San Jose State University who uses her art to create fantastical 3D art. Originally a Graphic Design major, she uses her past experiences in that field to build her art in the digital space. She creates bold and experimental art using Blender. She takes inspiration from cartoons, life experiences, and stories from others to build the foundation of her art. She aims to bring her art and creativity into the gaming industry. </p>

        <p>As a child with 3 older siblings, Sabrina ended up with a lot of their old art supplies that they no longer used. This included play-doe, clay, watercolor paint, crayons, and colored pencils. She also watched her father do woodworking and her grandmother sewed clothes that she would gift to Sabrina and her siblings. Sabrina ended up being drawn to using these supplies and being exposed to various forms of art. These experiences Sabrina has carried into her art as she is not content with sticking with one form of art even digitally. </p>
