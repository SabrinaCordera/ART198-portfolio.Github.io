                <p>It’s Here shows illness as a twisted form of a human who stands in the background haunting a person. This short film follows someone who is diagnosed with a form of cancer. Even when the illness in the person is gone, it haunts the family. 
                    As someone fortunate enough to be healthy their entire life and have their family have no health issues, it's a gut-retching emotion to discover that a close family member has been diagnosed with a serious health issue. It also hurts when it is disclosed to you later than the other members to keep your peace of mind. To learn that the illness can also be genetic is devastating to hear about. The situation puts one’s mind into overdrive with questions of how serious it is, what is the treatment plan, and whether it will be affordable.</p>
